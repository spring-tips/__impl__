# Implementation Code for producing Spring Tips videos themselves

This project supports the creation of the videos themselves. 

If you want to bulk-clone all the repositories, use the following incantation:

export ST_CODE=$HOME/Desktop/spring-tips-code # you can use whatever environment variables you'd like 

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-tips/_impl_/master/github/install.sh | /bin/bash
